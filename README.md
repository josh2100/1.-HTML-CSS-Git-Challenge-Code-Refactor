# University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp Code Refactor Challenge

This assignment required me to refactor a website called Horiseon for accessibility and Search Engine Optimization.

The file structure was unnecessarily complex, so I simplified it.

The starter code had broken links and missing alt image descriptions that I repaired. I added a meta description and fixed the title for SEO. I repaired improper tags, and changed divs to semantic elements such as nav, main, header, section, aside, and footer for improved readability. I repaired the broken anchor element, and commented to organize the HTML into logical sections.

The CSS file was messy and redundant. I commented and organized it by section, and consolidated CSS to eliminate many unneccessary lines of code.
